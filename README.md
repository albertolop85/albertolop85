- 👋 Hi, I’m Alberto Lopez (@albertolop85) and I live in Monterrey, Mexico. I currently work as a SDET but I have experience in different IT areas like Development, Integration and Automation Testing.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing myself around different IT topics, like improving my coding skills and get better in cloud related domains.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different languages and frameworks like Haskell or Angular and expanding my knowledge in other related frameworks and tools. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that could have a good impact and solve any problem we are facing, I am curious about sustainability, neurosciences and other unrelated topics.
